## Description
This is not my actual website, I use this as a testing ground for new react js libraries and components. 

This project was intended on allowing me the opourtunity to learn how the fundementals of React js work. I learned that it is truly amazing how easy it is to npm install a component and immediately start using it!
React js is extremely versitle and can greatly increase the production process of any web app. One thing that was fun to learn was how to implement react-router. Another thing to note: I found particle js which is a fantastic particle
engine to play with that has many many settings that can be changed and used. Very fun. Great learning project.
